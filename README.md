# hello-world
This is the first programme about how to create a reository on github

I'm a 24-years old man having lots of confuse about working.
I was married and bought a two-handed house half of year ago
So I need to pay 5000 every month to bank for my housing loan 

The github guide tell me to write something in this readme file, and I just write down something .
Wthat I've written down above is bushit.
